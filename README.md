# Seaside Modular Proteus Front Panel

These files are the starting point to make your own custom front panels. 

## Process

Everyone has their own process for this, but this is mine: 

- The Adobe Illustrator file is used to export an SVG file for each layer (these are in the svg_layers folder)
- Each svg layer is imported into KiCad into the appropriate layer
- Export gerber files for fabrication


You can use these files for whatever you want.  Make your own panels, sell them, whatever. Just please don't use the Seaside Modular logo.
